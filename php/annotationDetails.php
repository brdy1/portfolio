<span id="euripedes">This cultic hymn to Dionysus is taken from Euripides’ <em>Bacchae</em>. The hymn signifies a religious lustration (purification) ritual, and the direct translation of <em>όργια</em> into "orgy" gives this line a particularly sexual tone.</span>

<span id="robartes">A recurring personage in Yeats’ prose and poetry, leader of the Order of the Alchemical Rose. Yeats explains that Robartes is a “principle of the mind” – an archetypal energy or potentiality – and his magical elements are “fire reflected in water.”</span>

<span id="dominic">Saint Dominic (1170-1221), founder of the Friars Preachers who popularized the Catholic rosary. The order had strict rules, including one that friars of the order were "not to learn secular sciences or liberal arts except by dispensation."</span>

<span id="browne">Respected and loved by Romantic philosophers and poets, such as Charles Lamb (1775-1834) and Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834), and infamous in his own time, Sir Thomas Browne was a 17th-century physician who developed his own private, unorthodox opinions on various aspects of religion and the supernatural, published for the public (unbeknownst to Browne) in <em>Religio Medici</em> (<em>Religion of a Physician</em>).</span>

<span id="peacocks">Yeats and the Golden Dawn tradition used elaborate color scales in their practices, blue being associated with the Sephira Chesed in the second world (Heh, whose element is water) in their syncretic symbolic system. In the alchemical tradition, Luna feeds on the flesh of a peacock before the final stages of the Great Work. The peacock is also the sacred bird of Hera, Greek mother goddess (Roman Juno), and it also appears on the King of Cups (fire of water – which are the elements ascribed to Michael Robartes) of Chic and Sandra Cicero’s recent <em>New Golden Dawn Ritual Tarot</em>.</span>

<span id="crevelli">Carlo Crivelli (1435-1495) was an Italian Renaissance painter and often painted depictions of Madonna and Child. The narrator looks at one of these depictions here. Below, Crivelli's <em>La Madonna della Rondine</em> (<em>The Madonna of the Swallow</em>), from <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/carlo-crivelli-la-madonna-della-rondine-the-madonna-of-the-swallow" target="_blank">The National Gallery</a>. <img src="images/crivelli173x240.png" width="173px" height="240px"></span>

<span id="francesca">Piero della Francesca (1415-1492), another early Italian Renaissance painter, most famous for <em>The Legend of the True Cross</em> and other depictions of the life of the biblical Jesus.</span>

<span id="hera">Hera is Greek goddess of women and marriage, and the wife of Zeus. The narrator is looking at the tapestries of peacocks mentioned above.</span>

<span id="peletier">Rue le Peletier is a street in the 2nd arrondissement of downtown Paris, France, a significant business district and home of many glazed sidewalks in the 19th century.</span>

<span id="raymondlully">Or Raymond Lull, 13th-century philosopher and rational mystic. A rational mystic pursues experiential validity for fact through altered states of consciousness and other mystical practices, in addition to traditionally scientific methods. Some have suggested that his system of logic was the beginning of information science. Though he wrote prolifically on art, science, and philosophy, many texts on esoteric subjects were misattributed to Lull in the Middle Ages.</span>

<span id="alembic">An <em>alembic</em> is a type of retort consisting of two vessels, connected by a tube, in which substances are distilled or heated for purification.<br><img src="images/alembic.png"></span>

<span id="athanor">An <em>athanor</em>, literally “oven,” is an alchemist’s furnace used to maintain a significant heat over a long period of time, used to “warm the alchemical egg of the philosophers, which nested in sand or ashes” (Haeffner, <em>Dictionary of Alchemy</em>, 30).</span>

<span id="lavacrum">Latin for “bath of the sea,” an alchemical water bath in which alchemical art often depicts Sol and Luna washing naked. </span>

<span id="ninth">There are a total of twelve keys in the Valentine publication. Here, the “fires at the end of the world” suggest dissolution of the material consciousness and the leaden ego in order to begin to reform the psyche.</span>

<span id="basil">Called in English Basil Valentine, an alleged 15th-century alchemist. Science historian Lawrence Principe suggests that this personage was merely a pseudonym for a later philosopher and mystic, Johann Tholde. He also explains that the name is derived from two Latin words, <em>basileos valens</em>, a phrase that means “powerful king” (Principe, <em>The Secrets of Alchemy</em>, 140).</span>

<span id="swift">Jonathan Swift, like Yeats, was an Anglo-Irish poet. Yeats considered Swift the “chief representative of the intellect of his epoch” but also “long pondered the ambivalences of Swift's unstable national loyalties” to Ireland (<em>Mythologies</em> 377).</span>

<span id="curran">John Philpot Curran (1750-1817), Irish orator, politician, and wit. These two men - Swift and Curran - are for Yeats exemplars of a time marked by sharp intellect and wit.</span>

<span id="romanticmovement">The Romantics – of which Yeats considered himself the last in his poem “Coole and Ballylee, 1931” – began a spiritual movement and would invite even greater occult, psychological revelations that this website attempts to explicate.</span>

<span id="maenads">Female followers of Dionysus, sometimes called bacchae or bacchantes. Their name comes from the Greek <em>maenades</em>, meaning "mad" or "demented." During the orgiastic rites of Dionysus, the maenades were granted unusual strength as the god possessed them, making them dance as they wander the mountains and forests.</span>

<span id="fontana">Fontana was an Italian potter (1510-1571) who specialized in pottery with colorful painted decoration. Amulets are traditionally used as symbols of protection.</span>

<span id="purplepetals"><em>Passiflora</em>, known also as passion flowers.</span>

<span id="gethsemane">The name Gethsemane derives from an Aramaic word meaning “oil press,” designating an olive orchard on the western slope of the Mount of Olives. Gethsemane is the garden in which Christ spends his time praying and weeping in agony before his crucifixion when, according to the Gospel of Luke, "his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground." The Greek word <em>Χρίστος</em> (<em>christos</em>) comes from the translation of the Hebrew word mashiah (messiah), which means “anointed,” i.e. to consecrate with oil in a ceremony. According to the Gospel, Jesus’ betrayal occurs right after his agony in Gethsemane. This event in the life of Jesus symbolizes the peak of the antithetical condition, where an individual sacrifices his beauty found in phase fifteen of Yeats’ system to return to the primary. See Matthew 26:36-46, Mark 14:32-42, and Luke 22:39-46. The garden is simply called “garden” in John 18:1.</span>

<span id="banyantree"><em>Paradise Lost</em> IX.1101-7. Yeats evokes Milton’s motherly banyan tree to highlight the success of the incense’s temptation:<br>

<p class="quote">“The fig-tree, not that kind for fruit renown’d;<br>

But such as at this day, to Indians known,<br>

In Malabar or Deccan spreads her arms<br>

Branching so broad and long, that in the ground<br>

The bended twigs take root, And daughters grow<br>

About the mother-tree, a pillar’d shade<br>

High over-arch’d, and echoing walks between.”</p></span>

<span id="calvary">Calvary, also called Golgotha (from a Hebrew word meaning "skull"), is the site at which Jesus is crucified in the Gospel. Eleusis (from έλευσις, “arrival”) is a town in Greece, about ten miles northwest of Athens. Eleusis was the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries, initiation ceremonies promising unification with the gods and gifts and power in the afterlife. The narrator questions Robartes about why he should be pagan or polytheistic rather than some form of Christian monotheism.</span>

<span id="roland">Roland was prefect of the Breton March and commander of the rear guard of Charlemagne’s army in the 8th century. The Battle of Roncesvalles is recounted in The Song of Roland, the oldest known work of French literature (dated to 1040-1115), and in Orlando Furioso, an Italian work. Here Yeats uses the Spanish, rather than French and English, spelling of the valley (Roncevaux). In the poem, Roland is rebuked for being too proud to blow his horn for help. He eventually puts his pride aside, however, and blows his horn.</span>

<span id="hamlet"><em>Hamlet</em> is one of Shakespeare's more prominently alchemical plays. As Carney remarks,<br>

<p class="quote">Hamlet participates in a process of restoration which includes both his destruction and fulfillment...dissolution, separation, putrefaction, fixation, and projection. His world, like the world of the alchemists, is full of the potentialities of taint or tincture.</p>
</span>

<span id="gods"><em>them</em>: the gods</span>

<span id="faust">Faust is a legendary German historical figure who makes a deal with the Devil in order to subject the spirits to his will. The two most popular renditions of the Faust legend with which Yeats would have been familiar are Marlowe's <em>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</em> and Goethe's <em>Faust</em>.</span>

<span id="birdsfish">In Greek religion, animal sacrifice, including edible birds and fishes, was common. Ritualistic animal sacrifice was meant to symbolize the purification of the human soul by removal of the animal nature via sympathetic identification.</span>

<span id="garland">Garlands, bands or chains of flowers, were used in Greek culture to decorate buildings and their banquet tables, and spiral garlands were popular in Byzantine culture.</span>

<span id="themany">The many would later become in <em>A Vision</em> identified with the general population who are fixed in a passive, primary mode of thinking. By contrast, poets, creatives, and occultists would reach the antithetical, or "the one." Yeats and his occultist friends, like those after whom Michael Robartes is modeled, experimented with practices like astral travel, scrying, meditation, and even "deathlike trances." Robartes suggests that the gods are not human-made: rather, conscious human life is god-made(or archetype-made).</span>

<span id="lear">King Lear wanders out into a thunderstorm in 3.2:<br>
<p class="quote">Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!<br>
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout<br>
Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!<br>
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires,<br>
Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,<br>
Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,<br>
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,<br>
Crack nature’s molds, all germens spill at once<br>
That make ingrateful man!</p><br>
Robartes compares Lear to a god or archetypal force that exists through the narrator having read or watched the play.</span>

<span id="beatrice">Muse and guide of Dante Alighieri from the end of <em>Purgatorio</em> and into <em>Paradiso</em>. (Virgil, being a pagan, cannot enter Paradise.) Robartes evokes Beatrice as another god our narrator “met with in books,” a feminine divinity or archetypal energy met through the poetry of Dante.</span>

<span id="humility">Mary, holding a symbolic rose, which for Yeats and the Golden Dawn symbolizes the redemption of spirit through matter or the unfolding or development of human consciousness, hence “every petal is a god.” Some Catholic iconography depicts Mary with a rose in hand, and one of her poetic titles in Catholic Marian devotion is Rosa Mystica or Mystic Rose. For paintings of Mary and roses, see Botticelli's <em>Madonna of the Rose Garden</em> (ca. 1469), Schongauer's <em>Madonna in Rose Garden</em> (ca. 1473), and Lochner's <em>Madonna of the Rose Bower</em> (ca. 1440). Robartes explains that Christ is so powerful a figure that his followers close their hearts to the entry of a plurality of gods. Compare this image to the attempt by the three magi to reconcile monotheism and polytheism in "The Adoration of the Magi." See also the <a href="#crevelli">note on Crivelli</a> above.</span>

<span id="aphrodite">Greek goddess of love, daughter of Zeus, wife of Haphaestus, and mother of Eros. In Sappho, sparrows draw Aphrodite's chariot, but classically doves, the bird of love, draw it.</span>

<span id="mirror">This is a remarkably nonmagical view of the human life and of mirrors. Indeed, in the magical tradition, rather than being used as a precise reflection of the material world, mirrors were used for scrying, where the imagination is projected onto a blank matrix. American psychologist Leonard Zusne, in <em>Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking</em> suggests that images seen through scrying are hypnagogic experiences - a state between waking and dreaming, when lunar consciousness meets solar.</span>

<span id="avicenna">Persian polymath whose name is shortened to Ibn Sina or the Latinized name Avicenna (980-1037). He was an alchemist, but is most famous for The Book of Healing, which incorporated Aristotle's <em>De generatione et corruptione (On Generation and Corruption), and The Canon of Medicine, an extensive medical encyclopedia.</span>

<span id="struggled">The narrator suggests revelation of reincarnation, karmic law, and a soul's karmic destiny, two ideas popular in 19th- and 20th-century occult groups.</span>

<span id="mirror2">The mirror, which the narrator compares to his own mind above, is broken into more and more pieces, until his mind becomes more receptive to imagination and spiritual things.</span>

<span id="beauty">Beauty or Tipherath, which is the sixth Sephiroth on the Tree of Life of the Qabalistic system used by Yeats and the Golden Dawn, signifies a death and rebirth and bears a striking relation to the fifteenth phase of Yeats’ Great Wheel, the “Perfection of Beauty” of the antithetical.</span>

<span id="hystericapassio">King Lear, self-diagnosing his mental condition: “O, how this mother swells up toward my heart! / Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow, thy element’s below” (2.4.55-7).</span>

<span id="eternity">This “oneness with eternity” being one of the goals of the hermetic tradition and alchemy. To be one with eternity (to enter a world made “wholly of essences”) is to be overtaken by sheer ecstasy – emotions and archetypal potencies - marking a reversal of energies in the human mind.</span>

<span id="voteen"><em>voteen</em>: <em>Irish Gaelic</em>. A very religious person; a devotee.</span>

<span id="incorporate">As Yeats explains in <em>Wind Among the Reeds</em>, Michael Robartes is a principle of the mind, or an immortal spirit, himself. When he dies, the supreme work (Great Work) will be finished.</span>

<span id="artemis">Greek goddess of animals, the wild, and virginity. A mullet is a type of ray-finned fish common in Mediterranean Europe.</span>

<span id="dagda">The Dagda is a father-like god of Irish mythology associated with staves and cauldrons.</span>

<span id="lugh">Lú (also Lug or Lugh), Irish god, son of Cian and Ethniu. The only way to cure the spear’s thirst for blood was to put sleeping potion (poppy-juice) on it.</span>

<span id="angus">Aengus (also Óengus or Aonghus) is the son of Dagda, member of Tuatha Dé Danaan, and Irish god of love, youth, and poetry. He is representative of the archetypal young man or divine youth.</span>

<span id="bove">Bodb Derg, brother of Aengus. His swineherd grapples with that of the king of the Connacht.</span>

<span id="dana">Dana is the mother goddess of Tuatha Dé Danann, to which many of the previously mentioned figures belong. Tuatha Dé Danann  means literally “people of the goddess Dana.”</span>

<span id="shee">In Irish myth, the Shee (usually spelled Sidhe) are immortal faery spirits who, after the Sons of Mil (the Gaels) invaded Ireland, dwell underground in the hills.</span>

<span id="hurley">Hurley, or hurling, is a traditional Irish game in which two teams use sticks to put a ball in the goal at either side of a field.</span>

<span id="blackpig">Prophesied by St. Columbkille (Columba) (521-597), a battle which Yeats imagines in <em>The Celtic Twilight</em> (1893) as “Swine of the Gods” and about which he later writes in “Valley of the Black Pig,” a poem published in <em>The Wind Among the Reeds</em> (1899).</span>

<span id="morienus">Morienus, an ascetic, was a 5th-century Roman alchemist and hermit. Hair-cloth was used in the process of mortification, slaying the disease of the soul to restore and invigorate the soul’s true, immortal life. Garments made of goats’ hair were worn by ascetics to resist temptations of the flesh and by ordinary folks as an antidote to the outward luxury they exhibited.</span>

<span id="alfarabi">Al-Farabi, known also as Alpharabius (ca. 872-950 or 951), Islamic scientist and philosopher. He was called in his time and after “The Second Teacher,” being second to Aristotle.</span>

<span id="transformed">In Hindu tradition, the red rooster symbolizes a mass spiritual awakening. In alchemy the red elixir, according to Lully, grants the alchemist infinite amounts of Sol (associoated with the Sun and Sulfur).</span>

<span id="flamel">Nicolas Flamel, legendary French alchemist, born in Paris. He allegedly learned alchemical secrets from either a Jewish manuscript or Jewish convert. His wife's name is usually spelled <em>Paranelle</em>. Notably, <em>Nicolas</em> means "victory of the people," and Flamel means "flame."</span>

<span id="dervishes">Sufi mystics noted for wild,devotional dances meant to put the dancer into an ecstatic trance.</span>

<span id="prophetical">Blake, whose poetry and symbolism inspired Yeats in his youth, wrote prophetic texts, including <em>Tiriel</em>, <em>The Book of Thel</em>, <em>America a Prophecy</em>, <em>Europe a Prophecy</em>, and <em>Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion</em>. The quoted line is from <em>Europe a Prophecy</em> (1794), Plate XIV, line 3.</span>

<span id="chariots">In the alchemical and hermetic tradition, adepts symbolically ascend to the sky, to heaven, or to a paradise. In the Bible, Elijah ascends to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11). This symbolism signifies the sublimation of the creative force of the individual, which allows one to ascend to higher levels of consciousness. The Golden Dawn system attributes The Chariot tarot card to the zodiacal constellation Cancer.</span>

<span id="rosespears">Seemingly symbolic of a failed attempt to extinguish or otherwise assault the development of consciousness, or the redemption of spirit through matter, symbolized by the rose.</span>

<span id="splendorsolis">Dated around 1582, <em>Splendor Solis</em> (<em>Splendor of the Sun</em>) by Salomon Trismosin, a colorful set of 22 plates considered among the greatest depictions of the various stages of alchemy.</span>

<span id="pelican">Associated with the final stage in the alchemical process (<em>rubedo</em>, the reddening) the pelican is sometimes an emblem of Christ whose blood redeems mankind. The pelican was also a nickname of an alchemical apparatus used to “digest substances by long steeping in hot fluid to extract the essence,” also called the circulatory still. Normally, an alembic's distillate goes from the retort to another vessel where condensation occurs. In a pelican, the distillate runs back into the retort to be distilled continuously, purifying the liquid continuously. (Haeffner 178).</span>

<span id="greendragon">The green Dragon is associated with a stage of the alchemical process called the greening.</span>

<span id="eagle">The white eagle is symbolic of the whitening, or <em>albedo</em>, of the alchemical process, during which the practitioner purifies the metal being transmuted, a spiritualization of the body. Notably, the Rose Croix degree of Freemasonry is fully named "Eighteenth Degree, or Sovereign Prince of Rose Croix de Herodem and Knight of the Eagle and Pelican."</span>

<span id="saltmercury">Two of the three prima materia: Salt is the body, and Mercury the spirit. See the <a href="thesis.php">Introduction</a>.</span>

<span id="eros">Eros is the Greek god of love. That is, Eros – personified sexual energy – allowed the embodiment of archetypal spirits or “divine souls” to speak subconsciously, symbolically, and spiritually to those spiritually "asleep."</span>

<span id="ate">Atë, or Aite, Greek goddess of ruin, folly, and delusion.</span>

<span id="hermes">For an extensive description and explanation of Hermes and his significance in magic and the works included in this volume, see the <a href="thesis.php">Introduction</a>. In addition to assisting as psychopomp those traverse past the hellhound Cerberus and into the underworld, Hermes is god of the imagination – the connection between unconscious and conscious and thus he and the imagination dictate how powerful the protective hound will be.</span>

<span id="ravenna">The Baptistry of Neon, a religious building in Ravenna, central Italy.</span>

<span id="blacklilies">The white lily is a symbol of purity and truth, and therefore black lilies are symbolic of lies and deceit, negative emotions, and death.</span>

<span id="legion">The narratory assumes that the spirits with which he interacted while with Robartes were demons, called Legion in the Bible. For the biblical Legion that is cast into a herd of swine, see Mark 5:9, Luke 8:30 and Matthew 8:28-34. The narrator turns to the rosary (an object used for prayer) of Catholicism, a remarkably primary religion whose central tenets require passivity and abnegation of spiritual independence to clergy and the Papacy – whose First Vatican Council claimed the Pope’s infallibility in 1870. This turn appears to mark a fear of spiritual independence.</span>

<span id="title">The title of this story, “The Tables of the Law,” alludes to the tables Moses carried from Mount Sinai after God revealed his commandments to him. This story is a rebuke and replacement of these tables and their laws, signifying a new spiritual age marked by spiritual independence and self-reliance. See Exodus 24-31.</span>

<span id="biretta">A square cap worn by clergymen with three or four upright pieces extending from the topmost center to the edge. Owen Aherne, an embodiment of esoteric, theological philosophies and mysticism, refused to be a clergyman.</span>

<span id="reawakening">Yeats explained that the imagination had been buried within a tomb of criticism (see the final paragraph of the introduction), and the three stories of this volume call for a reinvigoration of the imagination and spirit.</span>

<span id="jesuits">Members of a religious order of the Roman Catholic Church (Society of Jesus) that works with cultural and intellectual research.</span>

<span id="francesca">Piero della Francesca (1415-1492), a painter of the Early Italian Renaissance.</span>

<span id="michaelangelo">From Greek <em>sibylla</em>, which means “prophetess” a sibyl was a woman supposed to have uttered the oracles and prophecies of the gods. Five sibyls are painted on Michaelangelo's frescoes of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican: <em>Libyan Sibyl</em>, <em>Cumaean Sibyl</em>, <em>Delphic Sibyl</em>, <em>Erythraean Sibyl</em>, and <em>Persian Sibyl</em>.</span>

<span id="pre-raph">The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, founded in 1848 by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others, grew to include seven members and aimed to return the composition of art to an aesthetic marked by an abundance of detail, color, and complexity, and which was popular before the artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo.</span>

<span id="siena">Siena is in Tuscany, Italy and home of Duomo di Siena (Siena Cathedral) - with paintings and frescoes by Michaelangelo, Donatello, and Pinturicchio - and the Santa Maria Della Scala - with frescoes such as Nativity of the Virgin by Lorenzetti, and others by Simone Martini.</span>

<span id="joachim">Joachim de Fiore, or Joachim of Fiore (c. 1135-1202), Italian mystic and theologian. Joachim de Fiore's spiritual-historical-theological system is the foundation for Owen Aherne's own.</span>

<span id="apocalypsin">Latin, <em>Explanation of the Revelation</em></span>

<span id="kingdomfather">In Fiore's philosophy, the Kingdom of the Father preceded the incarnation of Christ and was marked by an obedience to the law.</span>

<span id="kingdomson">The Kingdom of the Son, according to Fiore, was the period following the incarnation of Christ, marked by Man becoming the son of God and reedeming mankind.</span>

<span id="kingdomspirit">The Kingdom of the Spirit was yet to come for Fiore and would be marked by a direct contact with God and a spreading of universal love preached by Jesus in the gospel.</span>

<span id="spiritualis">Latin, intelligence pertaining to the spirit; spiritual understanding.</span>

<span id="canevari">Demetrio Canevari (1559-1625), a Genoese book collector.</span>

<span id="clovio">Giorgio Giulio Clovio, (1498-1578) considered to be the greatest illuminator of the Italian High Renaissance and the last in the tradition of illuminating manuscripts. Illuminators produced documents with borders, large lettering, or miniature illustrations. A strict definition of an illuminated manuscript refers to one decorated with gold and silver.</span>

<span id="thebook">The décor of the book and its container are similar to the very tripartite philosophy of eras expressed within: bronze, associated with eternity and durability, symbolizes the Father; the pages are gilded, symbolizing the Son; and its cover is a tarnished silver, symbolizing the Spirit.</span>

<span id="aretino">Aretino is an Italian surname referring to someone who lived in Arezzo, a Tuscan city. This person may be a lesser-known historical individual, but he may also be invented by Yeats, perhaps a combination of the two names Pietro Aretino (an Italian playwright, poet, and satirist) and his patron Giulio de' Medici.</span>

<span id="mirandola">Mirandola was an Italian renaissance philosopher (1463-1494), and one of his chief aims was to reconcile religion and philosophy using cabbalistic theories.</span>

<span id="fractura">“The Breaking of the Tables,” the tables being the titular tables - those of Moses on Sinai from Exodus.</span>

<span id="amore">Lionel Johnson translated Aherne’s Latin phrases for Yeats. Here and elsewhere, the Latin is a literal translation of the accompanying English phrase.</span>

<span id="commandmentoflove">“I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another.” John 13:34.</span>

<span id="hating">From Swift’s <em>Various Thoughts, Moral and Diverting</em>: “We have just enough Religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.”</span>

<span id="noblesentence">“Now you see that the hope and the desire of returning home and to one's former state is like the moth to the light, and that the man who with constant longing awaits with joy each new spring time, each new summer, each new month and new year – deeming that the things he longs for are ever too late in coming – does not perceive that he is longing for his own destruction. But this desire is the very quintessence, the spirit of the elements, which finding itself imprisoned with the soul is ever longing to return from the human body to its giver. And you must know that this same longing is that quintessence, inseparable from nature, and that man is the image of the world” (The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, xix. Jean Paul Richter, trans.) This sentiment expressed by da Vinci is at its core alchemical – the spirit for him was the quinta essentia and gives the individual a longing for God, which is oneness, which is really his own dissolution.</span>

<span id="fourcourts">A neoclassical building in Inns Quay, Dublin. It is the location of the Supreme Court, High Court, Dublin Circuit Court, and formerly the Central Criminal Court.</span>

<span id="hidden">For the tradition of hiding a visionary after his or her vision of the divine, see Moses after the vision on Sinai in Exodus 34:30-5. In the biblical passage, Moses’ face becomes so radiant from looking upon the divine, Aaron and the other Israelites are too afraid to look upon him or come near him. After Moses relays what God told him on Mount Sinai, Moses veils his face. As a direct parallel, Aherne reveals the new tables to our narrator in the conversation that follows.</span>

<span id="thurible">A thurible is a censer, a bowl for burning incense, suspended upon a chain or chains, used in Mass and in ceremonial magic.</span>

<span id="afteraherne">This story takes place just after <a href="tables.php">“Tables of the Law.”</a></span>

<span id="inquietude">A reference to the veil covering the Holy of Holies, torn after Christ’s death on the cross. See Matthew 27:50-1, Mark 15:37-8, and Luke 23:45-6. In 1922, 25 years after he authored this story, Yeats wrote in the preface to his autobiographical <em>The Trembling of the Veil</em> that he "found in an old diary a quotation from Stephane Mallarmé, saying that his epoch was troubled by the trembling of the veil of the Temple" and that "those words were still true, during the years of [his] life described" in the book.</span>

<span id="mallarme2">Stephane Mallarmé (1842-1898), French symbolist, critic, and poet.</span>

<span id="poteen">Or poitín, one of the strongest alcoholic beverages in the world, illegal in Ireland during Yeats’s time, from 1661 until 1997.</span>

<span id="eclogues">Eclogues, the first of the three major works by the Roman poet Virgil. The fifth eclogue is a dialogue between Mopsus and Menalcas, in which they sing praise to the nymph Daphnis, inventor of pastoral poetry and son of (or sometimes simply well-favored by) the god Hermes. For a description of Hermes, see introduction.</span>

<span id="paris">During the middle- to late-19th and early-20th centuries, artists considered Paris a place in which the arts and the intellect had the ability to flourish, and the city birthed a variety of modes of artistic expression during this time. Yeats frequented Paris throughout his life.</span>

<span id="seine">A river in France that runs through Paris and into the English Channel.</span>

<span id="malevolent">In alchemical and religious symbolism, fire, the last substance and the highest in the Ladder of Nature, is an energizing and purifying agent, and, according to seventeenth-century alchemist Thomas Vaughan, “the mask and skreen [screen] of the almighty” (qtd. in Haeffner 87). Here, Yeats portrays the harlot as the alchemical vessel that gives birth to a new age.</span>

<span id="hermes">Hermes</span>

<span id="threefeathers">The source story for this is unknown, but in the early Christian tradition (which Yeats came to understand through Saint Patrick) three feathers symbolized both truth and the three virtues (hope, charity, and faith), perhaps borrowed from the Egyptian symbol of the feather of Ma’at, which weighed the heart’s virtuosity after death as seen used in the Old Testament – Job 31:6 and Daniel 5:27.</span>

<span id="blackmass">Parody ritual of the Catholic Mass, used primarily in satanic groups.</span>

<span id="seacht">The following are the first six lines of a Celtic devotional prayer entitled “Seven Paters Seven Times,” first in Irish and then translated into English. Gould and Toomey remark that, according Yeats, “the distinction between good and evil faery hosts had come in ‘with Christianity, and its belief about the prince of the air...for the host of the Sidhe...are closely associated with the wind’” (Mythologies 430). This Christian rendition of the prayer conflates Celtic and Christian beliefs but also shows that the Christian era (by way of establishing fear of the spirits) suppressed spiritual independence and sovereignty of consciousness, as it seems to do for the narrator, paralleling the endings to the two previous stories. This type of thinking, as discussed in the introduction, keeps the stories’ narrator in a remarkably primary condition.</span>
