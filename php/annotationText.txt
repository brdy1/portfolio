euripedes|This cultic hymn to Dionysus is taken from Euripides’ <em>Bacchae</em>. The hymn signifies a religious lustration (purification) ritual, and the direct translation of <em>όργια</em> into "orgy" gives this line a particularly sexual tone.|no||
robartes|A recurring personage in Yeats’ prose and poetry, leader of the Order of the Alchemical Rose. Yeats explains that Robartes is a “principle of the mind” – an archetypal energy or potentiality – and his magical elements are “fire reflected in water.”|no||
dominic|Saint Dominic (1170-1221), founder of the Friars Preachers who popularized the Catholic rosary. The order had strict rules, including one that friars of the order were "not to learn secular sciences or liberal arts except by dispensation."|no||
browne|Respected and loved by Romantic philosophers and poets, such as Charles Lamb (1775-1834) and Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834), and infamous in his own time, Sir Thomas Browne was a 17th-century physician who developed his own private, unorthodox opinions on various aspects of religion and the supernatural, published for the public (unbeknownst to Browne) in <em>Religio Medici</em> (<em>Religion of a Physician</em>).|no||
peacocks|Yeats and the Golden Dawn tradition used elaborate color scales in their practices, blue being associated with the Sephira Chesed in the second world (Heh, whose element is water) in their syncretic symbolic system. In the alchemical tradition, Luna feeds on the flesh of a peacock before the final stages of the Great Work. The peacock is also the sacred bird of Hera, Greek mother goddess (Roman Juno), and it also appears on the King of Cups (fire of water – which are the elements ascribed to Michael Robartes) of Chic and Sandra Cicero’s recent <em>New Golden Dawn Ritual Tarot</em>.|no||
crevelli|Carlo Crivelli (1435-1495) was an Italian Renaissance painter and often painted depictions of Madonna and Child. The narrator looks at one of these depictions here. Below, Crivelli's <em>La Madonna della Rondine</em> (<em>The Madonna of the Swallow</em>), from <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/carlo-crivelli-la-madonna-della-rondine-the-madonna-of-the-swallow" target="_blank">The National Gallery</a>.|yes|173|240

peletier|Rue le Peletier is a street in the 2nd arrondissement of downtown Paris, France, a significant business district and home of many glazed sidewalks in the 19th century.|no||
raymondlully|Or Raymond Lull, 13th-century philosopher and rational mystic. A rational mystic pursues experiential validity for fact through altered states of consciousness and other mystical practices, in addition to traditionally scientific methods. Some have suggested that his system of logic was the beginning of information science. Though he wrote prolifically on art, science, and philosophy, many texts on esoteric subjects were misattributed to Lull in the Middle Ages.|no||
alembic|An <em>alembic</em> is a type of retort consisting of two vessels, connected by a tube, in which substances are distilled or heated for purification.<br>|yes|300|197
athanor|An <em>athanor</em>, literally “oven,” is an alchemist’s furnace used to maintain a significant heat over a long period of time, used to “warm the alchemical egg of the philosophers, which nested in sand or ashes” (Haeffner, <em>Dictionary of Alchemy</em>, 30).|no||
lavacrum|Latin for “bath of the sea,” an alchemical water bath in which alchemical art often depicts Sol and Luna washing naked. |no||

basil|Called in English Basil Valentine, an alleged 15th-century alchemist. Science historian Lawrence Principe suggests that this personage was merely a pseudonym for a later philosopher and mystic, Johann Tholde. He also explains that the name is derived from two Latin words, <em>basileos valens</em>, a phrase that means “powerful king” (Principe, <em>The Secrets of Alchemy</em>, 140).|no||
swift|Jonathan Swift, like Yeats, was an Anglo-Irish poet. Yeats considered Swift the “chief representative of the intellect of his epoch” but also “long pondered the ambivalences of Swift's unstable national loyalties” to Ireland (<em>Mythologies</em> 377).|no||
curran|John Philpot Curran (1750-1817), Irish orator, politician, and wit. These two men - Swift and Curran - are for Yeats exemplars of a time marked by sharp intellect and wit.|no||
romanticmovement|The Romantics – of which Yeats considered himself the last in his poem “Coole and Ballylee, 1931” – began a spiritual movement and would invite even greater occult, psychological revelations that this website attempts to explicate.|no||
maenads|Female followers of Dionysus, sometimes called bacchae or bacchantes. Their name comes from the Greek <em>maenades</em>, meaning "mad" or "demented." During the orgiastic rites of Dionysus, the maenades were granted unusual strength as the god possessed them, making them dance as they wander the mountains and forests.|no||
fontana|Fontana was an Italian potter (1510-1571) who specialized in pottery with colorful painted decoration. Amulets are traditionally used as symbols of protection.|no||
purplepetals|<em>Passiflora</em>, known also as passion flowers.|no||
gethsemane|The name Gethsemane derives from an Aramaic word meaning “oil press,” designating an olive orchard on the western slope of the Mount of Olives. Gethsemane is the garden in which Christ spends his time praying and weeping in agony before his crucifixion when, according to the Gospel of Luke, "his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground." The Greek word <em>Χρίστος</em> (<em>christos</em>) comes from the translation of the Hebrew word mashiah (messiah), which means “anointed,” i.e. to consecrate with oil in a ceremony. According to the Gospel, Jesus’ betrayal occurs right after his agony in Gethsemane. This event in the life of Jesus symbolizes the peak of the antithetical condition, where an individual sacrifices his beauty found in phase fifteen of Yeats’ system to return to the primary. See Matthew 26:36-46, Mark 14:32-42, and Luke 22:39-46. The garden is simply called “garden” in John 18:1.|no||
banyantree|<em>Paradise Lost</em> IX.1101-7. Yeats evokes Milton’s motherly banyan tree to highlight the success of the incense’s temptation:<br><p class="quote">“The fig-tree, not that kind for fruit renown’d;<br>But such as at this day, to Indians known,<br>In Malabar or Deccan spreads her arms<br>Branching so broad and long, that in the ground<br>The bended twigs take root, And daughters grow<br>About the mother-tree, a pillar’d shade<br>High over-arch’d, and echoing walks between.”</p>|no||
calvary|Calvary, also called Golgotha (from a Hebrew word meaning "skull"), is the site at which Jesus is crucified in the Gospel. Eleusis (from έλευσις, “arrival”) is a town in Greece, about ten miles northwest of Athens. Eleusis was the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries, initiation ceremonies promising unification with the gods and gifts and power in the afterlife. The narrator questions Robartes about why he should be pagan or polytheistic rather than some form of Christian monotheism.|no||
roland|Roland was prefect of the Breton March and commander of the rear guard of Charlemagne’s army in the 8th century. The Battle of Roncesvalles is recounted in The Song of Roland, the oldest known work of French literature (dated to 1040-1115), and in Orlando Furioso, an Italian work. Here Yeats uses the Spanish, rather than French and English, spelling of the valley (Roncevaux). In the poem, Roland is rebuked for being too proud to blow his horn for help. He eventually puts his pride aside, however, and blows his horn.|no||
hamlet|<em>Hamlet</em> is one of Shakespeare's more prominently alchemical plays. As Carney remarks,<br><p class="quote">Hamlet participates in a process of restoration which includes both his destruction and fulfillment...dissolution, separation, putrefaction, fixation, and projection. His world, like the world of the alchemists, is full of the potentialities of taint or tincture.</p>|no||
gods|<em>them</em>: the gods|no||
faust|Faust is a legendary German historical figure who makes a deal with the Devil in order to subject the spirits to his will. The two most popular renditions of the Faust legend with which Yeats would have been familiar are Marlowe's <em>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</em> and Goethe's <em>Faust</em>.|no||
birdsfish|In Greek religion, animal sacrifice, including edible birds and fishes, was common. Ritualistic animal sacrifice was meant to symbolize the purification of the human soul by removal of the animal nature via sympathetic identification.|no||
garland|Garlands, bands or chains of flowers, were used in Greek culture to decorate buildings and their banquet tables, and spiral garlands were popular in Byzantine culture.|no||
themany|The many would later become in <em>A Vision</em> identified with the general population who are fixed in a passive, primary mode of thinking. By contrast, poets, creatives, and occultists would reach the antithetical, or "the one." Yeats and his occultist friends, like those after whom Michael Robartes is modeled, experimented with practices like astral travel, scrying, meditation, and even "deathlike trances." Robartes suggests that the gods are not human-made: rather, conscious human life is god-made(or archetype-made).|no||
lear|King Lear wanders out into a thunderstorm in 3.2:<br><p class="quote">Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!<br>You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout<br>Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!<br>You sulfurous and thought-executing fires,<br>Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,<br>Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,<br>Smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,<br>Crack nature’s molds, all germens spill at once<br>That make ingrateful man!</p><br>Robartes compares Lear to a god or archetypal force that exists through the narrator having read or watched the play.|no||
beatrice|Muse and guide of Dante Alighieri from the end of <em>Purgatorio</em> and into <em>Paradiso</em>. (Virgil, being a pagan, cannot enter Paradise.) Robartes evokes Beatrice as another god our narrator “met with in books,” a feminine divinity or archetypal energy met through the poetry of Dante.|no||
humility|Mary, holding a symbolic rose, which for Yeats and the Golden Dawn symbolizes the redemption of spirit through matter or the unfolding or development of human consciousness, hence “every petal is a god.” Some Catholic iconography depicts Mary with a rose in hand, and one of her poetic titles in Catholic Marian devotion is Rosa Mystica or Mystic Rose. For paintings of Mary and roses, see Botticelli's <em>Madonna of the Rose Garden</em> (ca. 1469), Schongauer's <em>Madonna in Rose Garden</em> (ca. 1473), and Lochner's <em>Madonna of the Rose Bower</em> (ca. 1440). Robartes explains that Christ is so powerful a figure that his followers close their hearts to the entry of a plurality of gods. Compare this image to the attempt by the three magi to reconcile monotheism and polytheism in "The Adoration of the Magi." See also the <a href="#crevelli"> note on Crivelli</a> above.|no||
aphrodite|Greek goddess of love, daughter of Zeus, wife of Haphaestus, and mother of Eros. In Sappho, sparrows draw Aphrodite's chariot, but classically doves, the bird of love, draw it.|no||
mirror|This is a remarkably nonmagical view of the human life and of mirrors. Indeed, in the magical tradition, rather than being used as a precise reflection of the material world, mirrors were used for scrying, where the imagination is projected onto a blank matrix. American psychologist Leonard Zusne, in <em>Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking</em> suggests that images seen through scrying are hypnagogic experiences - a state between waking and dreaming, when lunar consciousness meets solar.|no||
avicenna|Persian polymath whose name is shortened to Ibn Sina or the Latinized name Avicenna (980-1037). He was an alchemist, but is most famous for The Book of Healing, which incorporated Aristotle's <em>De generatione et corruptione (On Generation and Corruption)</em>, and <em>The Canon of Medicine</em>, an extensive medical encyclopedia.|no||
struggled|The narrator suggests revelation of reincarnation, karmic law, and a soul's karmic destiny, two ideas popular in 19th- and 20th-century occult groups.|no||
mirror2|The mirror, which the narrator compares to his own mind above, is broken into more and more pieces, until his mind becomes more receptive to imagination and spiritual things.|no||
beauty|Beauty or Tipherath, which is the sixth Sephiroth on the Tree of Life of the Qabalistic system used by Yeats and the Golden Dawn, signifies a death and rebirth and bears a striking relation to the fifteenth phase of Yeats’ Great Wheel, the “Perfection of Beauty” of the antithetical.|no||
hystericapassio|King Lear, self-diagnosing his mental condition: “O, how this mother swells up toward my heart! / Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow, thy element’s below” (2.4.55-7).|no||
eternity|This “oneness with eternity” being one of the goals of the hermetic tradition and alchemy. To be one with eternity (to enter a world made “wholly of essences”) is to be overtaken by sheer ecstasy – emotions and archetypal potencies - marking a reversal of energies in the human mind.|no||
voteen|<em>voteen</em>: <em>Irish Gaelic</em>. A very religious person; a devotee.|no||

bove|Bodb Derg, brother of Aengus. His swineherd grapples with that of the king of the Connacht.|no||
dana|Dana is the mother goddess of Tuatha Dé Danann, to which many of the previously mentioned figures belong. Tuatha Dé Danann  means literally “people of the goddess Dana.”|no||

hurley|Hurley, or hurling, is a traditional Irish game in which two teams use sticks to put a ball in the goal at either side of a field.|no||
blackpig|Prophesied by St. Columbkille (Columba) (521-597), a battle which Yeats imagines in <em>The Celtic Twilight</em> (1893) as “Swine of the Gods” and about which he later writes in “Valley of the Black Pig,” a poem published in <em>The Wind Among the Reeds</em> (1899).|no||
morienus|Morienus, an ascetic, was a 5th-century Roman alchemist and hermit. Hair-cloth was used in the process of mortification, slaying the disease of the soul to restore and invigorate the soul’s true, immortal life. Garments made of goats’ hair were worn by ascetics to resist temptations of the flesh and by ordinary folks as an antidote to the outward luxury they exhibited.|no||
alfarabi|Al-Farabi, known also as Alpharabius (ca. 872-950 or 951), Islamic scientist and philosopher. He was called in his time and after “The Second Teacher,” being second to Aristotle.|no||
transformed|In Hindu tradition, the red rooster symbolizes a mass spiritual awakening. In alchemy the red elixir, according to Lully, grants the alchemist infinite amounts of Sol (associoated with the Sun and Sulfur).|no||
flamel|Nicolas Flamel, legendary French alchemist, born in Paris. He allegedly learned alchemical secrets from either a Jewish manuscript or Jewish convert. His wife's name is usually spelled <em>Paranelle</em>. Notably, <em>Nicolas</em> means "victory of the people," and Flamel means "flame."|no||
dervishes|Sufi mystics noted for wild,devotional dances meant to put the dancer into an ecstatic trance.|no||
prophetical|Blake, whose poetry and symbolism inspired Yeats in his youth, wrote prophetic texts, including <em>Tiriel</em>, <em>The Book of Thel</em>, <em>America a Prophecy</em>, <em>Europe a Prophecy</em>, and <em>Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion</em>. The quoted line is from <em>Europe a Prophecy</em> (1794), Plate XIV, line 3.|no||
chariots|In the alchemical and hermetic tradition, adepts symbolically ascend to the sky, to heaven, or to a paradise. In the Bible, Elijah ascends to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11). This symbolism signifies the sublimation of the creative force of the individual, which allows one to ascend to higher levels of consciousness. The Golden Dawn system attributes The Chariot tarot card to the zodiacal constellation Cancer.|no||
rosespears|Seemingly symbolic of a failed attempt to extinguish or otherwise assault the development of consciousness, or the redemption of spirit through matter, symbolized by the rose.|no||
splendorsolis|Dated around 1582, <em>Splendor Solis</em> (<em>Splendor of the Sun</em>) by Salomon Trismosin, a colorful set of 22 plates considered among the greatest depictions of the various stages of alchemy.|no||
pelican|Associated with the final stage in the alchemical process (<em>rubedo</em>, the reddening) the pelican is sometimes an emblem of Christ whose blood redeems mankind. The pelican was also a nickname of an alchemical apparatus used to “digest substances by long steeping in hot fluid to extract the essence,” also called the circulatory still. Normally, an alembic's distillate goes from the retort to another vessel where condensation occurs. In a pelican, the distillate runs back into the retort to be distilled continuously, purifying the liquid continuously. (Haeffner 178).|no||
greendragon|The green Dragon is associated with a stage of the alchemical process called the greening.|no||
eagle|The white eagle is symbolic of the whitening, or <em>albedo</em>, of the alchemical process, during which the practitioner purifies the metal being transmuted, a spiritualization of the body. Notably, the Rose Croix degree of Freemasonry is fully named "Eighteenth Degree, or Sovereign Prince of Rose Croix de Herodem and Knight of the Eagle and Pelican."|no||
saltmercury|Two of the three prima materia: Salt is the body, and Mercury the spirit. See the <a href="thesis.php">Introduction</a>.|no||

ate|Atë, or Aite, Greek goddess of ruin, folly, and delusion.|no||
hermes|For an extensive description and explanation of Hermes and his significance in magic and the works included in this volume, see the <a href="thesis.php">Introduction</a>. In addition to assisting as psychopomp those traverse past the hellhound Cerberus and into the underworld, Hermes is god of the imagination – the connection between unconscious and conscious and thus he and the imagination dictate how powerful the protective hound will be.|no||
ravenna|The Baptistry of Neon, a religious building in Ravenna, central Italy.|no||
blacklilies|The white lily is a symbol of purity and truth, and therefore black lilies are symbolic of lies and deceit, negative emotions, and death.|no||
legion|The narrator assumes that the spirits with which he interacted while with Robartes were demons, called Legion in the Bible. For the biblical Legion that is cast into a herd of swine, see Mark 5:9, Luke 8:30 and Matthew 8:28-34. The narrator turns to the rosary (an object used for prayer) of Catholicism, a remarkably primary religion whose central tenets require passivity and abnegation of spiritual independence to clergy and the Papacy – whose First Vatican Council claimed the Pope’s infallibility in 1870. This turn appears to mark a fear of spiritual independence.|no||
title|The title of this story, “The Tables of the Law,” alludes to the tables Moses carried from Mount Sinai after God revealed his commandments to him. This story is a rebuke and replacement of these tables and their laws, signifying a new spiritual age marked by spiritual independence and self-reliance. See Exodus 24-31.|no||

Five sibyls are painted on Michaelangelo's frescoes of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican: <em>Libyan Sibyl</em>, <em>Cumaean Sibyl</em>, <em>Delphic Sibyl</em>, <em>Erythraean Sibyl</em>, and <em>Persian Sibyl</em>.|no||
pre-raph|The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, founded in 1848 by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others, grew to include seven members and aimed to return the composition of art to an aesthetic marked by an abundance of detail, color, and complexity, and which was popular before the artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo.|no||

aretino|Aretino is an Italian surname referring to someone who lived in Arezzo, a Tuscan city. This person may be a lesser-known historical individual, but he may also be invented by Yeats, perhaps a combination of the two names Pietro Aretino (an Italian playwright, poet, and satirist) and his patron Giulio de' Medici.|no||

hating|From Swift’s <em>Various Thoughts, Moral and Diverting</em>: “We have just enough Religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.”|no||
noblesentence|“Now you see that the hope and the desire of returning home and to one's former state is like the moth to the light, and that the man who with constant longing awaits with joy each new spring time, each new summer, each new month and new year – deeming that the things he longs for are ever too late in coming – does not perceive that he is longing for his own destruction. But this desire is the very quintessence, the spirit of the elements, which finding itself imprisoned with the soul is ever longing to return from the human body to its giver. And you must know that this same longing is that quintessence, inseparable from nature, and that man is the image of the world” (The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, xix. Jean Paul Richter, trans.) This sentiment expressed by da Vinci is at its core alchemical – the spirit for him was the quinta essentia and gives the individual a longing for God, which is oneness, which is really his own dissolution.|no||

hidden|For the tradition of hiding a visionary after his or her vision of the divine, see Moses after the vision on Sinai in Exodus 34:30-5. In the biblical passage, Moses’ face becomes so radiant from looking upon the divine, Aaron and the other Israelites are too afraid to look upon him or come near him. After Moses relays what God told him on Mount Sinai, Moses veils his face. As a direct parallel, Aherne reveals the new tables to our narrator in the conversation that follows.|no||

inquietude|A reference to the veil covering the Holy of Holies, torn after Christ’s death on the cross. See Matthew 27:50-1, Mark 15:37-8, and Luke 23:45-6. In 1922, 25 years after he authored this story, Yeats wrote in the preface to his autobiographical <em>The Trembling of the Veil</em> that he "found in an old diary a quotation from Stephane Mallarmé, saying that his epoch was troubled by the trembling of the veil of the Temple" and that "those words were still true, during the years of [his] life described" in the book.|no||

poteen|Or poitín, one of the strongest alcoholic beverages in the world, illegal in Ireland during Yeats’s time, from 1661 until 1997.|no||
brendan|Saint Brendan the Navigator, legendary Irish abbot and sea traveler who in the <em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em> sailed for seven years in search of the Land of Promise of the Saints.|no||
phaeacians|Islanders in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> who listen to Odysseus’ travails leading up to book 5 of the epic and whose king’s palace had doors of gold and walls of bronze, guarded by gold and silver hounds, marking the same decor used for the precious book and its container in “The Tables of the Law.”|no||
eclogues|Eclogues, the first of the three major works by the Roman poet Virgil. The fifth eclogue is a dialogue between Mopsus and Menalcas, in which they sing praise to the nymph Daphnis, inventor of pastoral poetry and son of (or sometimes simply well-favored by) the god Hermes. For a description of Hermes, see introduction.|no||
paris|During the middle- to late-19th and early-20th centuries, artists considered Paris a place in which the arts and the intellect had the ability to flourish, and the city birthed a variety of modes of artistic expression during this time. Yeats frequented Paris throughout his life.|no||
seine|A river in France that runs through Paris and into the English Channel.|no||
malevolent|In alchemical and religious symbolism, fire, the last substance and the highest in the Ladder of Nature, is an energizing and purifying agent, and, according to seventeenth-century alchemist Thomas Vaughan, “the mask and skreen [screen] of the almighty” (qtd. in Haeffner 87). Here, Yeats portrays the harlot as the alchemical vessel that gives birth to a new age.|no||
threefeathers|The source story for this is unknown, but in the early Christian tradition (which Yeats came to understand through Saint Patrick) three feathers symbolized both truth and the three virtues (hope, charity, and faith), perhaps borrowed from the Egyptian symbol of the feather of Ma’at, which weighed the heart’s virtuosity after death as seen used in the Old Testament – Job 31:6 and Daniel 5:27.|no||
blackmass|Parody ritual of the Catholic Mass, used primarily in satanic groups.|no||
seacht|The following are the first six lines of a Celtic devotional prayer entitled “Seven Paters Seven Times,” first in Irish and then translated into English. Gould and Toomey remark that, according Yeats, “the distinction between good and evil faery hosts had come in ‘with Christianity, and its belief about the prince of the air...for the host of the Sidhe...are closely associated with the wind’” (Mythologies 430). This Christian rendition of the prayer conflates Celtic and Christian beliefs but also shows that the Christian era (by way of establishing fear of the spirits) suppressed spiritual independence and sovereignty of consciousness, as it seems to do for the narrator, paralleling the endings to the two previous stories. This type of thinking, as discussed in the introduction, keeps the stories’ narrator in a remarkably primary condition.|no||
