<h2>The Adoration of the Magi</h2>

<p>I was sitting reading late into the night <span class="annotation" id="afteraherne">a little after my last meeting with Aherne</span>, when I heard a light knocking on my front door; and found upon the doorstep three very old men with stout sticks in their hands, who said they had been told I would be up and about, and that they were to tell me important things. I brought them into my study, and when the peacock curtains had closed behind us, I set their chairs for them close to the fire, for I saw that the frost was on their great-coats of frieze and upon the long beards that flowed almost to their waists. They took off their great-coats, and leaned over the fire warming their hands, and I saw that their clothes had much of the country of our time, but a little also, as it seemed to me, of the town life of a more courtly time. When they had warmed themselves—and they warmed themselves, I thought, less because of the cold of the night than because of a pleasure in warmth for the sake of warmth—they turned towards me, so that the light of the lamp fell full upon their weather-beaten faces, and told the story I am about to tell. Now one talked and now another, and they often interrupted one another, with a desire, like that of countrymen, when they tell a story, to leave no detail untold. When they had finished, they made me take notes of whatever conversation they had quoted, so that I might have the exact words, and got up to go, and when I asked them where they were going, and what they were doing, and by what names I should call them, they would tell me nothing, except that they had been commanded to travel over Ireland continually, and upon foot and at night, that they might live close to the stones and the trees and at the hours when the Immortals are awake.</p>

<p>I have let some years go by before writing out this story, for I am always in dread of the illusions which come of that <span class="annotation" id="inquietude">inquietude of the veil of the Temple</span>, which <span class="annotation" id="mallarme2">M. Mallarmé</span> considers a characteristic of our times; and only write it now because I have grown to believe that there is no dangerous idea which does not become less dangerous when written out in sincere and careful English.</p>

<p>The three old men were three brothers, who had lived in one of the western islands from their early manhood, and had cared all their lives for nothing except for those classical writers and old Gaelic writers who expounded an heroic and simple life. Night after night in winter, Gaelic story-tellers would chant old poems to them over the <span class="annotation" id="poteen">poteen</span>; and night after night in summer, when the Gaelic story-tellers were at work in the fields or away at the fishing, they would read to one another Virgil and Homer, for they would not enjoy in solitude, but as the ancients enjoyed. At last a man, who told them he was Michael Robartes, came to them in a fishing-boat, like <span class="annotation" id="brendan">Saint Brendan</span> drawn by some vision and called by some voice; and told them of the coming again of the gods and the ancient things; and their hearts, which had never endured the body and pressure of our time, but only of distant times, found nothing unlikely in anything he told them, but accepted all simply and were happy. Years passed, and one day, when the oldest of the old men, who had travelled in his youth and thought sometimes of other lands, looked out on the grey waters, on which the people see the dim outline of the Islands of the Young—the Happy Islands where the Gaelic heroes live the lives of Homer’s <span class="annotation" id="phaeacians">Phaeacians</span>—a voice came out of the air over the waters and told him of the death of Michael Robartes. While they were still mourning, the next oldest of the old men fell asleep whilst he was reading out the <span class="annotation" id="eclogues">Fifth Eclogue of Virgil</span>, and a strange voice spoke through him, and <span class="annotation" id="paris">bid them set out for Paris</span>, where a dying woman would give them secret names and thereby so transform the world that another Leda would open her knees to the swan, another Achilles beleaguer Troy.</p>

<p>They left their Island, and were at first troubled at all they saw in the world, and came to Paris, and there the youngest met a person in a dream, who told him they were to wander about at hazard until those who had been guiding their footsteps had brought them to a street and a house, whose likeness was shown him in the dream. They wandered hither and thither for many days, until one morning they came into some narrow and shabby streets, on the south of the <span class="annotation" id="seine">Seine</span>, where women with pale faces and untidy hair looked at them out of the windows; and just as they were about to turn back because Wisdom could not have alighted in so foolish a neighborhood, they came to a street and the house of the dream. The oldest of the old men, who still remembered some of the modern languages he had known in his youth, went up to the door and knocked, and when he had knocked, the next in age to him said it was not a good house, and could not be the house they were looking for, and urged him to ask for somebody who could not be there and go away. The door was opened by an old over-dressed woman, who said, ‘O, you are her three kinsmen from Ireland. She has been expecting you all day.’ The old men looked at one another and followed her upstairs, passing doors from which pale and untidy women thrust out their heads, and into a room where a beautiful woman lay asleep, another woman sitting by her.</p>

<p>The old woman said, ‘Yes they have come at last; now she will be able to die in peace,’ and went out.</p>

<p>‘We have been deceived by devils,’ said one of the old men, ‘for the Immortals would not speak through a woman like this.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said another, ‘we have been deceived by the devils, and we must go away quickly.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the third, ‘we have been deceived by devils, but let us kneel down for a little, for we are by the death-bed of one that has been beautiful.’ They knelt down, and the woman sitting by the bed whispered, and as though overcome with fear, and with lowered head, ‘At the moment when you knocked she was suddenly convulsed and cried out as I have heard a woman in childbirth and fell backward as though in a swoon.’ Then they watched for a little the face upon the pillow and wondered at its look, as of unquenchable desire, and at the porcelain-like refinement of <span class="annotation" id="malevolent">the vessel in which so malevolent a flame had burned</span>.</p>

<p>Suddenly the second oldest of them crowed like a cock, till the room seemed to shake with the crowing. The woman in the bed still slept on in here death-like sleep, but the woman who sat by her head crossed herself and grew pale, and the youngest of the old men cried out, ‘A devil has gone into him, and we must be-gone or it will go into us also.’ Before they could rise from their knees, a resonant chanting voice came from the lips that had crowed and said:— ‘I am not a devil, but I am Hermes the Shepherd of the Dead, I run upon the errands of the gods, and you have heard my sign. The woman who lies there has given birth, and that which she bore has the likeness of a unicorn and is most unlike man of all living things, being cold, hard and virginal. It seemed to be born dancing; and was gone from the room wellnigh upon the instant, for it is of the nature of the unicorn to understand the shortness of life. She does not know it has gone, for she fell into a stupor while it danced, but bend down your ears that you may learn the names that it must obey.’ Neither of the other two old men spoke, but doubtless looked at the speaker with perplexity, for the voice began again: ‘When the Immortals would overthrow the things that are to-day and bring the things that were yesterday, they have no one to help them, but one whom the things that are to-day have cast out. Bow down and very low, for they have chosen this woman in whose heart all follies have gathered, and in whose body all desires have awakened; this woman who has been driven out of Time and has lain upon the bosom of Eternity.’</p>

<p>The voice ended with a sigh, and immediately the old man awoke out of sleep, and said, ‘Has a voice spoken through me, as it did when I feel asleep over my Virgil, or have I only been asleep?’</p>

<p>The oldest of them said, ‘A voice has spoken through you. Where has your soul been while the voice was speaking through you?’</p>

<p>‘I do not know where my soul has been, but I dreamed I was under the roof of a manger, and I looked down and I saw an ox and an ass; and I saw a red cock perching on the hay-rack; and a woman hugging a child; and three old men in chain armour kneeling with their heads bowed very low in front of the woman and the child. While I was looking the cock crowed and <span class="annotation" id="hermes">a man with wings on his heels</span> swept up through the air, and as he passed me, cried out, “Foolish old men, you had once all the wisdom of the stars.” I do not understand my dream or what it would have us do, but you who have heard the voice out of the wisdom of my sleep know what we have to do.’</p>

<p>Then the oldest of the old men told him they were to take the parchments they had brought with them out of their pockets and spread them on the ground. When they had spread them on the ground, they took out of their pockets their pens, made of <span class="annotation" id="threefeathers">three feathers</span> which had fallen from the wing of the old eagle that is believed to have talked of wisdom with Saint Patrick.</p>

<p>‘He meant, I think,’ said the youngest, as he put their ink-bottles by the side of the rolls of parchment, ‘that when people are good the world likes them and takes possession of them, and so eternity comes through people who are not good or who have been forgotten. Perhaps Christianity was good and the world liked it, so now it is going away and the Immortals are beginning to awake.’</p>

<p>‘What you say has no wisdom,’ said the oldest, ‘because if there are many Immortals, there cannot be only one Immortal.’</p>

<p>‘Yet it seems,’ said the youngest, ‘that the names we are to take down are the names of one, so it must be that he can take many forms.’</p>

<p>Then the woman on the bed moved as in a dream, and held out her arms as though to clasp the being that had left her, and murmured names of endearment, and yet strange names, ‘Harsh sweetness,’ ‘Dear bitterness,’ ‘O solitude,’ ‘O terror,’ and after lay still for a while. Then her voice changed, and she, no longer afraid and happy but seeming like any dying woman, murmured a name so faintly that the woman who sat by the bed bent down and put her ear close to her mouth.</p>

<p>The oldest of the old men said in French, ‘There must have been yet one name which she had not given us, for she murmured a name while the spirit was going out of the body,’ and the woman said, ‘She was merely murmuring over the name of a symbolist painter she was fond of. He used to go to something he called the Black Mass, and it was he who taught her to see visions and to hear voices.’</p>

<p>This is all the old men told me, and when I think of their speech and of their silence, of their coming and of their going, I am almost persuaded that had I followed them out of the house, I would have found no footsteps in the snow. They may, for all I or any man can say, have been themselves Immortals: immortal demons, come to put an untrue story into my mind for some purpose I do not understand. Whatever they were, I have turned into a pathway which will lead me from them and from the Order of the Alchemical Rose. I no longer live an elaborate and haughty life, but seek to lose myself among the prayers and the sorrows of the multitude. I pray best in poor chapels, where frieze coats brush against me as I kneel, and when I pray against the demons I repeat <span class="annotation" id="seacht">a prayer</span> which was made I know not how many centuries ago to help some poor Gaelic man or woman who had suffered with a suffering like mine:—</p>
