<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I grew up in Grants Pass, Oregon and graduated in the class of 2005 from Grants Pass High School. After that, I attended Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Washington where I spent seven years obtaining my bachelor's and master's degrees. I then moved to sunny (and by contrast to my native area, dry) Phoenix, Arizona. I spent two years as a teacher, but left the field to pursue a career in libraries. Now I work as a Library Information Specialist Lead at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>In my free time I read books, play some video games, run campaigns in Pathfinder RPG, and I love spending time with my family during holidays. Through my passion for reading I've acquired a formidable library in my spare bedroom.</p>
